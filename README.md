# `// TODO: Study`

`// TODO: Study` is an integrated study buddy platform intended for students to get work done easily. This project is currently a work in progress and we will be making incremental improvements to the project as time progresses.

## Features
- Customisable account creation and editing
- **(work in progress)**
  - To-do list with a lot of customisation features. Will support batch adding tasks as well.
  - Study timer with two separate modes and timing methods for exam or study purposes. Timing an exam has never been easier! Also, it has built-in templates for study timing using the Pomodoro technique and much more.
  - A notes app, meant for quick typing in Markdown and text formats. Notes are easily sharable and exportable through various formats including Word, Markdown and HTML, and can be downloaded or shared on Telegram via our companion Telegram bot.
  - Telegram reminders for nearly-due assignments and other reminders through a Telegram bot.

## Features we are planning to implement
We may also implement these features, if time permits:
- Canvas integration for easy mass downloading of materials
- Companion mobile app
